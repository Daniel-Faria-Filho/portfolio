      "title": "FlyAway Virtual Flight School",
      "description": "FlyAway was a Discord community that aimed to help new Simulator Pilots learn how to fly realistically. I designed and developed the Discord bot and website for the community. The site and bot worked together via API that made them communicate user information and functions. It was a very complex system, but it gave me lot's of coding, backend, frontend, github, and other valuable knowledge moving forward. \n\nThe site is using Node.js, ejs extension, extensive API, and hosted using Nginx to flyawayvirtual.com."
